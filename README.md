### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was most proud of implementing grid with grid-template-areas, I feel like it's a very interesting way to format grid layouts within your code.

```css
.wrap-content {
	display: grid;
	padding: 0;
	grid-gap: 0;
	grid-template-areas: "c1" "c2" "c3";
	margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about grid and flex-box. these two tools were extremely useful. I still have some trouble debugging some bugs and knowing what looks good asthetically but I feel like I just need some more practice.

### Useful resources

- [Build a Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This helped me understand how to use grids and flexbox to organize my website. I also learned about some new vs code extentions such as prettier which helped make my code look neat and organised aswell.
